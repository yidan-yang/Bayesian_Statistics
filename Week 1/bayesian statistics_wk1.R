# eg 1: Suppose in a bag of M&M's with 5 different colors:
# red, green, yellow, blue, and orange. 
# Suppose the general percentage of yellow M&M's in a bag is 10%
# i.e., the probability of getting a yellowM&M is 0.1. 
# What would be the probability of getting 1 or more yellow M&M
# in a bag of 5 M&M's?
